To use these icons and also be able to use any icons from the ItemIcon atlas (and icons added the ItemIcons folder in a mod within the Mods folder) **atlas="ItemIconAtlas"** needs to be added in 3 places.

If buffs.xml you can for example change icon="ui_game_symbol_drunk" to icon="beer" and it will use the icon for the beer item. Note that the icon will get squished flat a bit. If you want the aspect ratio to be correct, the icon should be 64x64 pixels at the shape you want, then resize the icon to 116x80 and save as a .png to your Mods/Modname/ItemIcons folder.

Replace the **BuffPopoutList** window with the following (in windows.xml):

```
		<rect name="hud" pos="93,124" side="left" controller="BuffPopoutList" pivot="BottomLeft" >
			<panel width="168" height="43" name="item" visible="false" pivot="right" disableautobackground="true" pos="70, 0" >
				<sprite depth="3" pos="0,0" name="Background" sprite="ui_game_popup" height="43" width="162" pivot="center" flip="Horizontally" color="[transparent]" />
				<sprite depth="4" name="Icon" atlas="ItemIconAtlas" size="36,32" pos="-58,0" pivot="center" color="[transparent]"/>
				<label depth="6" name="TextContent" pos="0,0" font_size="28" color="[white]" justify="center" height="30" pivot="center"/>
			</panel>
		</rect>
```

Replace the **buffInfoPanel** window with the following (in windows.xml):

```
  <window name="buffInfoPanel" width="603" height="427" controller="BuffInfoWindow" anchor="CenterTop" panel="Center">
    <panel name="header" height="43" depth="1" backgroundspritename="ui_game_panel_header">
      <sprite depth="2" name="windowIcon" style="icon32px" pos="4,-5" atlas="ItemIconAtlas" sprite="{bufficon|once}"/>
      <label style="header.name" text="{buffname|once}"/>
    </panel>
    <rect name="contentBuffInfo" height="381" depth="1" pos="0,-46">
      <rect>
        <sprite depth="5" name="backgroundMain" sprite="menu_empty3px" width="603" height="381" color="[black]" type="sliced" fillcenter="false"/>
        <sprite depth="1" name="background" color="[black]" type="sliced" visible="false" sprite="menu_empty3px" fillcenter="false"/>
        <sprite depth="8" name="backgroundMain" sprite="menu_empty3px" pos="0,0" width="153" height="153" color="[black]" type="sliced" fillcenter="false"/>
        <sprite depth="1" pos="2,-3" name="preview" width="150" height="148" color="[darkGrey]" type="sliced"/>
        <sprite depth="3" name="itemPreview" width="100" height="100" atlas="ItemIconAtlas" sprite="{bufficon|once}" pos="27,-27" foregroundlayer="true"/>
        <sprite depth="8" name="backgroundMain" sprite="menu_empty3px" pos="0,-150" width="153" height="231" color="[black]" type="sliced" fillcenter="false"/>
        <grid name="itemActions" rows="4" cols="1" pos="3,-153" width="148" height="100%" cell_width="147" cell_height="42" controller="ItemActionList" repeat_content="true">
          <item_action_entry/>
        </grid>
        <sprite depth="3" name="fillerBackground" pos="3,-321" height="57" width="147" color="[mediumGrey]" type="sliced"/>
        <rect depth="1" pos="153,-3" name="description" width="447" height="195">
          <sprite depth="3" name="backgroundMain" sprite="menu_empty3px" pos="-3,3" width="453" height="201" color="[black]" type="sliced" fillcenter="false"/>
          <sprite depth="1" color="[mediumGrey]" type="sliced" globalopacity="true"/>
          <label depth="3" name="statText" pos="5,-6" width="443" text="{buffstats}"/>
        </rect>
        <rect depth="2" pos="153,-200" name="description" width="447" height="104">
          <sprite depth="1" color="[darkGrey]" type="sliced" globalopacity="true"/>
          <label depth="3" name="descriptionText" pos="6,-5" text="{buffdescription|once}" width="440"/>
        </rect>
        <grid rows="1" cols="6" pos="153,-306" cell_width="75" cell_height="75" repeat_content="true" controller="BuffItemList">
          <buff_item name="0"/>
        </grid>
      </rect>
    </rect>
  </window>
```

Finally replace **active_buff_entry** with the following (in controls.xml):

```
  <active_buff_entry>
    <panel height="43" controller="ActiveBuffEntry" width="314" style="press" sound="[recipe_click]" on_hover="true" disableautobackground="true" on_scroll="true">
      <sprite depth="2" name="backgroundMain" sprite="menu_empty3px" pos="-3,3" width="320" height="49" color="[black]" type="sliced" fillcenter="false"/>
      <sprite depth="0" name="background" color="[darkGrey]" type="sliced" height="45" width="316" pos="-1,1"/>
      <sprite depth="2" name="Icon" atlas="ItemIconAtlas" sprite="{bufficon|once}" style="icon32px" pos="5,-5"/>
      <label depth="2" pos="45,-8" width="280" height="30" text="{buffname|once}  [DECEA3]{buffdisplayinfo}[-]" font_size="28" pivot="topleft"/>
    </panel>
  </active_buff_entry>
```

Credit for the **atlas="ItemIconAtlas"** changes to Alphado-Jaki, DnaJur and n2n1.
